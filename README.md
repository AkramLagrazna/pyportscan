# pyportscan
Python Port Scanner
# lulz why
Since i was bored and not in the mood to work on my main project, i coded this in 30 mins, it's ***REALLY*** basic , and i'm planning to add os fingerprinting
# what is this
It's a Python 2.7 port scanner, SSH and FTP bruteforcer. 
This is still buggy.

**enjoy**
